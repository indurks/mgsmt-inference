# MGSMT Inference Module

The MGSMT Inference Module, which extends the [MGSMT parser](https://github.com/indurks/mgsmt), includes a procedure for inferring a Minimalist Grammar (MG) lexicon using the the [Z3 SMT-solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). If you use MGSMT Inference Module, please cite the [publication](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v217/indurkhya23a.html) detailing the inference procedure:

## Running the Inference Procedure

To see the inference procedure in action, you can run the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks. E.g. given input consisting of [Primary Linguistic Data](experiment-data/primary-linguistic-data.json) (each entry being a sentence paired with a skeletal representation of meaning), by successively running the four Jupyter Notebooks, the inference procedure will be used to (incrementally) infer an MG lexicon, concluding in the following lexicon:

![Final Inferred MG Lexicon](readme-imgs/example-inferred-mg-lexicon.png)

which in turn can, for example, yield an MG derivation for *"John has seen someone who was eating icecream."*, as shown below:

![MG Derivation for Example I38](readme-imgs/example-derivation-I38.png)

(See the [associated publication](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v217/indurkhya23a.html) for more details about this example.)
